# Coordinate Transformations with Proj.4 using Mapnik python's bindings
#
#


# With Mapnik you can transform data back and forth between a projected system
# and an unprojected, geographic coordinates (ie Longitude, and Latitude).
# Mapnik does not currently support transformations between two projected 
# systems, see: http://trac.mapnik.org/ticket/117


# Use forward to go from geographic coordinates to projected coordinates by initiating the projected coordinate system you'd like to convert into.

# Thus from WGS84 to World Mercator:

from mapnik import Coord, Projection
p = Projection('+init=epsg:3395')
long_lat = Coord(-122.0, 48.0)
mercator = p.forward(long_lat)
print mercator
# And to go from World Mercator to WGS84:

from mapnik import Coord, Projection
p = Projection('+init=epsg:3395')
mercator = Coord(-13580977.8768,6075085.09006)
long_lat = p.inverse(mercator)
print long_lat

# Note: it is easy to make the mistake of creating a Mapnik Projection Object in 
# the WGS84/geographic projection when needing to convert to and from this geographic
# projection and a projected system. Like in the above examples you need to create
# the projection object in a projected system.

# For example, this is wrong (but should be harmless since forwarding
# and inversing a geographic projection should do nothing):

from mapnik import Coord, Projection
p = Projection('+init=epsg:4326')
long_lat = Coord(-122.0, 48.0)
inv = p.inverse(long_lat)
forw = p.forward(long_lat)
if not inv == forw:
  print 'Something is wrong with your Proj.4/Mapnik Installation'
else:
  print 'No change'
