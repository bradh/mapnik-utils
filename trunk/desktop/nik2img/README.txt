nik2img
======

A command line utility to take a Mapnik xml or mml mapfile as input and output an image.

Use nik2img to interact with the Mapnik C++/Python mapping toolkit.
Mirrors the utility of the shp2img script provided with the MapServer project 
and complements the `generate_image.py` and `generate_tiles.py` scripts
used by the OpenStreetMap project to render Mapnik graphics.

To run this program:
    Make sure you have Mapnik installed (https://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/MapnikInstallation)
    Then install nik2img
    See INSTALL.txt for details
