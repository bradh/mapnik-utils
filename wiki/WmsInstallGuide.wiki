==Mapnik OGC WMS Server==

This is a sample mapnik WMS server configuration, along with a testing [http://mapnik-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tutorials/wms/openlayers.html Openlayers map].

All files can be found in http://mapnik-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tutorials/wms/

== Installation ==

=== Step 1 ===

 * Install the wms prequisites listed at: http://trac.mapnik.org/wiki/OgcServer
 * Decide whether to run as cgi or fastcgi (the server works with either)
 * If you want to run in fastcgi mode then install mod_fastcgi or mod_fcgi within apache
  * These hints might help:

   * http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2008/05/fastcgi-on-osx-leopard.html
 
=== Step 2 ===

 Configure Apache to allow python cgi execution in a specific directory, like the cgi-bin by either renaming the script to mapnikserv.cgi or adding an Apache directive to a custom directory like:
 {{{
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py # add .py 
 }}}

Or Configure fastcgi within apache by adding a directive to your apache conf like:
{{{
ScriptAlias /mapnik/ /path/to/wms/
<Directory "/path/to/wms/">
           AllowOverride All
           Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
           Order allow,deny
           Allow from all
           SetHandler fastcgi-script
</Directory>
}}}

Then make sure that apache can read from that folder:
{{{
sudo chown -R www-data /path/to/wms/
sudo chgrp -R www-data /path/to/wms/
sudo chmod -R g+rws /path/to/wms/
}}}
 
 Then place the `mapnikwms.py` python script within your cgi-bin or '/path/to/wms/' and make executable:
 {{{
 $ chmod +x mapnikwms.py
 }}} 

=== Step 3 ===

 Place the `ogcserver.conf` and `world_map_factory.py` beside each other in your location of choice.
 Fix the hardcoded paths:
  * The paths inside `mapnikwms.py` must point to the `ogcserver.conf` location.
  * The paths inside  `map_factory` must point to the correct location of the datasource.

=== Step 4 ===

 Go to your browser and open:
  * http://localhost/cgi-bin/mapnikwms.py?LAYERS=world&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application%2Fvnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG%3A4326&BBOX=-180.0000000000001,-90,119.46385052802589,209.463850528026&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256
  * Or use the url prefix 'http://localhost/mapnik/mapnikwms.py?' if you went with the fastcgi approach.

You should see a small tile of the world. If not check your apache logs.

=== Step 5 ===

 Open the `openlayers.html` (you will likely need to edit the base path in the html) to test your wms served into !OpenLayers
